Clues on WTAF is meant to happen & how to demonstrate it ...

Basic spring boot webApp (pinched the bit to generate classes from wsdl from soapCountryClient)

Once it's running, use Postman or similar to call it.
    http://localhost:9090/rest?country=Italy


On clean there will be lots of red.  Compile will auto-generate the stuff to fix it in
    target\classe\hello\wsdl

They will be in bit code and no point amending as the get blitzed each time anyway
NOTE : need the wsdl to be available (probably easiest to have soapCountryServer running on 8080.  Need to change the POM
if we change where to look for the WSDL (perhaps to a local copy)


Could look at amending the Name Space at some point ...
