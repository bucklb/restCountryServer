# restCountryServer

Does similar stuff to soapCountryServer, but via a restController.  Aim is both to be accessed via omniCountryServer

## Getting Started

mvn clean install

run it on port 9090 (as that's where omniCountryServer expects it)

### Prequisites

install and run soapCountryServer on 8080 (so its WSDL is exposed; needed to generate classes)
